# C Unit Test

This is very a lightweight and easy-to-use library for writing C unit tests.
It targets small hobby projects which don't need any advanced features (e.g. like code coverage).

Every TestSuite lives in his own main file so it is quickly compiled as standalone executable.

# Install
Download the source with the following git command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ToolsDevler/cunittest.git
```

Include the cunittest.h into your main file and write your unit tests.

For examples check out the 'examples' folder in this repository.
