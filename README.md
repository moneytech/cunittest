# C Unit Test

This is very a lightweight and easy-to-use library for writing C unit tests.
Every TestSuite lives in his own main file so it is quickly compiled as standalone
executable.

# Install
Download the source with the following git command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ToolsDevler/cunittest.git
```

Include the cunittest.h into your main file and write your unit tests.

For examples check out the 'examples' folder in this repository.
